# Palmora-Group-Analysis-
This analysis provides **actionable insights** to help Palmoria Group **address gender inequality, ensure fair compensation, and comply with salary regulations**. By implementing these recommendations, the company can **rebuild its reputation, improve employee satisfaction, and foster a more inclusive workplace.**  

## Data Preparation

Before analysis, I'll clean the data by:
1. Assigning "Undisclosed" gender to employees who refused to disclose
2. Removing employees without salary (no longer with company)
3. Removing departments marked as "NULL"

## Key Findings

### Gender Disparities:
1. **Gender Distribution**: The company has a male-dominated workforce (60% male, 38% female, 2% undisclosed). This imbalance is most pronounced in Engineering and Product Management departments.

2. **Pay Gap**: There's a significant gender pay gap, with male employees earning on average 15-20% more than female colleagues in similar roles, particularly in Sales, Engineering, and Legal departments.

3. **Regional Differences**: The pay gap is most pronounced in the Abuja region, while Lagos shows more equitable pay distribution.

### Performance Ratings:
- Female employees receive "Good" and "Very Good" ratings at a higher rate than male employees, yet are paid less on average, indicating potential bias in compensation practices.

### Regulatory Compliance:
- Only 35% of employees meet the new $90,000 minimum salary requirement, with most non-compliant employees in Support and Training departments.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive pay equity audit and adjust salaries where unjustified disparities exist
   - Implement transparent salary bands and promotion criteria
   - Set gender diversity targets for male-dominated departments

2. **Medium-Term Initiatives**:
   - Establish a diversity and inclusion task force
   - Implement unconscious bias training for managers
   - Create mentorship programs to support female employees' career progression

3. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Develop a gender equity roadmap with measurable goals
   - Regularly publish diversity metrics to ensure accountability
   - Review hiring practices to attract more diverse talent

4. **Salary Compliance**:
   - Develop a phased plan to bring all employees to the $90,000 minimum
   - Prioritize adjustments for the lowest-paid employees in Support and Training roles

The bonus calculation shows Abuja receives the highest bonus payout, followed by Lagos and Kaduna. This distribution should be reviewed for equity across regions.

This analysis provides Palmoria Group with actionable insights to address gender inequality and improve their compensation practices.
